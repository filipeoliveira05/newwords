# NewWords üìö

Welcome to NewWords, a mobile application built with React Native and Expo, designed to help users expand their vocabulary in an effective and fun way. The application allows users to create word sets (flashcards), practice with different mini-games, and track their learning progress.

## ‚ú® Overview

The main goal of this application is to be more than just a simple notepad; it aims to be a **personal learning tutor**. Through a robust architecture and plans for a Spaced Repetition System (SRS) and AI integrations, the application aims to optimize the process of memorizing new vocabulary.

---

## üöÄ Implemented Features

The application has a solid and scalable foundation, with the following features being 100% operational:

### 1. Full Deck Management

- **Full CRUD:** Create, view, edit, and delete decks.
- **Word Count:** The interface displays a real-time count of the number of words in each deck, keeping data synchronized across screens.

### 2. Full Word (Flashcard) Management

- **Full CRUD:** Add, view, edit, and delete words within a specific deck.
- **Smart Search:** A search field allows for quick filtering of words by name or meaning.
- **Polished Modal Interface:** A clean and reusable modal UI for adding and editing words, with saving indicators for enhanced UX feedback.

### 3. Advanced Architecture and Navigation

- **Centralized & Reactive State (Zustand):** All application data logic is managed by central stores (`deckStore`, `wordStore`, `practiceStore`).
- **Robust Database (Expo-SQLite):** Utilizes a local SQLite database with a fully asynchronous data access layer.
- **Typed & Nested Navigation (React Navigation):** The app uses a `BottomTabNavigator` with nested `StackNavigator`s, allowing for independent and type-safe navigation flows for each section (Decks, Practice, Stats). All navigation types are defined, ensuring code safety.
- **Optimized Components:** Rendering optimization techniques (e.g., `React.memo`, atomic state selectors) have been implemented to ensure a fluid UI without infinite loops.

### 4. Practice Hub Foundation

- **Multiple Game Modes:** The "Practice" tab is a hub where users can choose between "Classic Review" (Flashcards) and "Quick Quiz" (Multiple-Choice).
- **Intelligent Word Selection (SRS Level 1):** The practice algorithm is no longer random. It prioritizes words that have never been trained, have a higher error rate, or haven't been reviewed in a longer time.
- **Complete Practice Loop:**
  - Games are structured in rounds (e.g., 10 words).
  - A progress bar shows the user's position in the current round.
  - The results screen summarizes performance and allows the user to start a new round or exit.
- **Engaging UI/UX:**
  - **Animations:** The flashcard features a dynamic 3D flip animation.
  - **Gamification:** A "streak" counter tracks consecutive correct answers, and perfect rounds are celebrated with a confetti animation.
  - **Sensory Feedback:** Haptic feedback (vibrations) is provided for correct and incorrect answers, enhancing the interactive experience.
- **Persistent Stats Tracking:** Every answer in a practice session updates the word's statistics (`timesTrained`, `timesCorrect`, `lastTrained`, etc.) in the local database, laying the groundwork for advanced analytics.

### 5. Comprehensive Statistics and Gamification

- **Statistics Dashboard:** A dedicated screen (`StatsScreen`) provides users with key performance indicators, including global success rate, total words mastered, longest correct answer streak, and consecutive days of practice.
- **Activity Heatmap:** A visual calendar highlights practice days, with color intensity representing the volume of words trained, allowing users to see their consistency at a glance.
- **Dynamic Daily Goals:** To encourage daily engagement, the app presents three new, randomly selected goals each day (e.g., "Train 10 words," "Complete 1 session"). A countdown timer creates a sense of urgency.
- **Rich Achievement System:** A comprehensive list of unlockable achievements (badges) rewards users for reaching milestones related to practice, consistency, and vocabulary size. Unlocked achievements are persisted in the database and trigger a notification toast.
- **Actionable Insights:** The "Challenging Words" section automatically identifies the top 3 words with the lowest success rates. A dedicated button allows the user to instantly start a focused practice session with these words, creating a powerful and immediate improvement loop.

## üó∫Ô∏è Development Roadmap

With a robust foundation for practice and statistics, the focus now shifts to making the app more interactive, rewarding, and intelligent.

### üéØ Current Priorities

1.  **Enable Focused Learning**

    - **Goal:** Allow users to target their practice sessions for maximum efficiency.
    - **Tasks:**
      - [x] **Practice by Deck:** Add a "Practice this Deck" button to the `DeckDetailScreen` to allow users to study words from a single deck. This is a fundamental feature for focused learning.
      - [x] **Practice Mistakes:** On the session results screen, add a button to "Practice Mistakes" from the last round, creating a tight feedback loop for correcting errors.

2.  **Enhance Learning Feedback**
    - **Goal:** Provide instant, clear feedback to accelerate memorization.
    - **Tasks:**
      - [x] **Immediate Correction:** In the multiple-choice game, when a user selects an incorrect answer, immediately highlight the correct answer to reinforce the correct association.
      - [x] **Achievement Unlock Animation:** Add a special animation to the `AchievementBadge` component the first time it is rendered as "unlocked," making the moment of discovery more rewarding.

### üîÆ Future Features (Next Levels)

#### Level 1: Core Gameplay & Learning Loop (High-Impact)

- [x] üß† **Spaced Repetition System (SRS Core):** This is the most critical feature. Instead of simple statistics, each word should have a ‚Äúmastery‚Äù level (e.g., New, Learning, Mastered). The practice algorithm should prioritize words with lower mastery and those that have not been seen in a long time. This transforms the app from a simple ‚Äúgame‚Äù into a powerful learning tool.
- [x] ‚úçÔ∏è **Game Mode: Writing the Answer:** The most requested and effective way to test recall. Instead of choosing an option, the user must type the answer.
- [ ] üîä **Audio (Text-to-Speech):** Allow users to hear the pronunciation of words, adding a crucial audio component to learning.
- [ ] üìä **Visible Gamification Stats:** Display key stats like total words, day streak, and a new XP/Level metric in a prominent place, like the main screen's header, to constantly motivate the user.
- [ ] üåô **Dark Mode**

#### Level 2: The Habit Hook (Getting the User to Come Back)

- [ ] üîî **Smart Push Notifications:** Implement smart reminders to help users maintain their streak (‚Äúüî• Your 3-day streak is waiting for you!‚Äù) or review challenging words.
- [ ] üé≤ **New Game Modes:**

  - [ ] **Time Sprint:** A fast-paced mode: "How many words can you answer in 60 seconds?"
  - [x] **Complete the Phrase:** A sentence appears with a blank space in which the user must insert a word with the appropriate meaning.
  - [ ] **Matching Game:** A classic mode where users match words to their definitions from two columns.

- [ ] üèÜ **Shareable Milestones:** When a user unlocks an important achievement or reaches a new level, generate a beautiful, shareable image for social media to encourage sharing and organic growth.
- [ ] ‚¨ÖÔ∏è ‚û°Ô∏è **Tinder-Style Review:** Implement a fast and fluid swipe-right/swipe-left interface for flashcard review, making practice sessions more engaging.

#### Level 3: Content Depth & Community

- [ ] üìñ **Detailed Word View & Categories:** Create a dedicated screen for each word, showing more context like example sentences, synonyms, and its category (noun, verb, etc.). This turns the app into a personal, enriched dictionary.
- [ ] ü•á **Leaderboards & Leagues:** Introduce weekly leagues based on XP earned, fostering friendly competition and long-term retention.

#### Level 4: ü§ñ AI Magic

- [ ] **Definition and Example Sentence Generator:** Use an LLM API to assist in creating flashcards. The user writes the word, and an LLM API suggests the definition and an example sentence.
- [ ] **Word "Discoverer":** Allow the user to paste text or take a photo, and the app extracts the most difficult words, suggesting the creation of cards for them.

#### Level 5: Polish and Growth

- [ ] ‚òÅÔ∏è **Authentication and Cloud Sync.**
