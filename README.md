# NewWords üìö

Welcome to NewWords, a mobile application built with React Native and Expo, designed to help users expand their vocabulary in an effective and fun way. The application allows users to create word sets (flashcards), practice with different mini-games, and track their learning progress.

## ‚ú® Overview

The main goal of this application is to be more than just a simple notepad; it aims to be a **personal learning tutor**. Through a robust architecture and plans for a Spaced Repetition System (SRS) and AI integrations, the application aims to optimize the process of memorizing new vocabulary.

---

## üöÄ Implemented Features

The application has a solid and scalable foundation, with the following features being 100% operational:

### 1. Full Deck Management

- **Full CRUD:** Create, view, edit, and delete decks.
- **Word Count:** The interface displays a real-time count of the number of words in each deck, keeping data synchronized across screens.

### 2. Full Word (Flashcard) Management

- **Full CRUD:** Add, view, edit, and delete words within a specific deck.
- **Smart Search:** A search field allows for quick filtering of words by name or meaning.
- **Polished Modal Interface:** A clean and reusable modal UI for adding and editing words, with saving indicators for enhanced UX feedback.

### 3. Advanced Architecture and Navigation

- **Centralized & Reactive State (Zustand):** All application data logic is managed by central stores (`deckStore`, `wordStore`, `practiceStore`).
- **Robust Database (Expo-SQLite):** Utilizes a local SQLite database with a fully asynchronous data access layer.
- **Typed & Nested Navigation (React Navigation):** The app uses a `BottomTabNavigator` with nested `StackNavigator`s, allowing for independent and type-safe navigation flows for each section (Decks, Practice, Stats). All navigation types are defined, ensuring code safety.
- **Optimized Components:** Rendering optimization techniques (e.g., `React.memo`, atomic state selectors) have been implemented to ensure a fluid UI without infinite loops.

### 4. Practice Hub Foundation

- **Multiple Game Modes:** The "Practice" tab is a hub where users can choose between "Classic Review" (Flashcards) and "Quick Quiz" (Multiple-Choice).
- **Intelligent Word Selection (SRS Level 1):** The practice algorithm is no longer random. It prioritizes words that have never been trained, have a higher error rate, or haven't been reviewed in a longer time.
- **Complete Practice Loop:**
  - Games are structured in rounds (e.g., 10 words).
  - A progress bar shows the user's position in the current round.
  - The results screen summarizes performance and allows the user to start a new round or exit.
- **Engaging UI/UX:**
  - **Animations:** The flashcard features a dynamic 3D flip animation.
  - **Gamification:** A "streak" counter tracks consecutive correct answers, and perfect rounds are celebrated with a confetti animation.
  - **Sensory Feedback:** Haptic feedback (vibrations) is provided for correct and incorrect answers, enhancing the interactive experience.
- **Persistent Stats Tracking:** Every answer in a practice session updates the word's statistics (`timesTrained`, `timesCorrect`, `lastTrained`, etc.) in the local database, laying the groundwork for advanced analytics.

## üó∫Ô∏è Development Roadmap

With a robust and engaging practice system now in place, the focus shifts to providing users with meaningful insights into their learning journey.

### üéØ Current Priorities

1.  **Implement the Statistics Screen (`StatsScreen`)**
    - **Goal:** Allow users to visualize their learning progress.
    - **Tasks:**
      - [ ] **Create SQL Queries:** Develop functions in `services/storage.ts` to fetch aggregate data (e.g., global success rate, most frequently missed words, practice activity over time).
      - [ ] **Build the UI:** Design and implement the `StatsScreen` to display this data using charts and lists, providing actionable insights for the user.

### üîÆ Future Features (Next Levels)

#### Level 1: Core Improvements

- [ ] **Alternative Training Modes:** Add a "Writing Game" (type the word based on its meaning).
- [ ] **Internationalization (i18n):** Abstract all UI text into translation files.

#### Level 2: AI Magic

- [ ] **Definition and Example Sentence Generator:** Use an LLM API to assist in creating flashcards.
- [ ] **Word "Discoverer":** Extract vocabulary from a photo or pasted text.

#### Level 3: Polish and Growth

- [ ] **Authentication and Cloud Sync.**
- [ ] **Push Notifications for Practice Reminders.**
- [ ] **Dark Mode.**

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Main Tech Stack

- **Framework:** React Native (Expo)
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **State Management:** Zustand
- **Database:** Expo-SQLite (with `next` API)
- **Navigation:** React Navigation (v6)
- **UI:** React Native's built-in components and icon libraries.
